# OpenNeuroStudies

Welcome to **OpenNeuroStudies** – a comprehensive collection of BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) study datasets that brings together original datasets and their derivatives in one organized ecosystem.

> **⚠️ Under Construction**: This organization is currently being assembled and not all studies are available yet. If you're interested in facilitating a particular study to be included, please file an issue at [OpenNeuroStudies/OpenNeuroStudies](https://github.com/OpenNeuroStudies/OpenNeuroStudies/issues).

## Purpose

OpenNeuroStudies provides curated BIDS study datasets for each of the OpenNeuro datasets, grouping:

- **Original datasets** from [OpenNeuroDatasets](https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/)
- **Derivative datasets** either:
  - Directly on OpenNeuro ([OpenNeuroDatasets](https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/))
  - Among [OpenNeuroDerivatives](https://github.com/OpenNeuroDerivatives/)
  - Other sources and processing pipelines

## The Super Dataset

[OpenNeuroStudies/OpenNeuroStudies](https://github.com/OpenNeuroStudies/OpenNeuroStudies/) serves as the **super dataset to bind them all** – a central repository that collates useful summaries and provides a unified entry point to explore the entire collection of studies.

## What You'll Find Here

Each repository in the OpenNeuroStudies organization represents a complete study, including:

- Links to the original raw data
- Associated derivatives and processing outputs
- Documentation and metadata
- Cross-references between related datasets
- Useful summaries and analysis results

## Getting Started

1. Browse our [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/OpenNeuroStudies/repositories) to find studies of interest
2. Visit the [super dataset](https://github.com/OpenNeuroStudies/OpenNeuroStudies/) for an overview of all available studies
3. Follow links to the original datasets on [OpenNeuroDatasets](https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/)
4. Explore derivatives on [OpenNeuroDerivatives](https://github.com/OpenNeuroDerivatives/)

## Contributing

OpenNeuroStudies is part of the broader OpenNeuro ecosystem. For questions or contributions, please refer to individual repository guidelines or the main [OpenNeuro project](https://openneuro.org/).
